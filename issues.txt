** SOLVED **. refreshing an Info page no longer works - route is reloading, but displayInfo content isn't.

Fixed issue by converting Info from stateless functional component to @observer class

Now calling store's getSelectedPerson function from Info, passing in id (from this.props.params.id)

Refreshing on a person's info page now works properly.
